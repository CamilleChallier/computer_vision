    "This exercise session revolves around the ideas of shape from texture. It consists of two independent tasks (1) on normal estimation from texture density and (2) on ellipse detection with a specialised variant of the Hough transform. The two tasks can be done in any order so we invite you to read both and start with the one you find easier/faster. Task 2 might appear longer, but it mostly consists in texts and explanations you have to read and understand. The actual code to write is not that long."
