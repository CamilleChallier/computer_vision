# Computer Vision Course 2024
Computer Vision is the branch of Computer Science whose goal is to model the real world or to recognize objects from digital images. These images can be acquired using still and video cameras, infrared cameras, radars, or specialized sensors such as those used in the medical field.

The students will be introduced to the basic techniques of the field of Computer Vision. They will learn to apply Image Processing techniques where appropriate.

We will concentrate on the black and white and color images acquired using standard video cameras. We will introduce basic processing techniques, such as edge detection, segmentation, texture characterization, and shape recognition.
